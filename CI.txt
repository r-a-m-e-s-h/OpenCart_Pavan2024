CI
---
in the initial build we dont do the automation scripts
after 2 to 3 build only we start creating our automation scripts
most of the time sanity testcase is tested in jenkins i.e basic functionalities tested

maven-build tool
jenkins-run our automation
github- code maintenance

how qa works:
at the end of the day we need push the modified code to GitHub

2 tools needed:
---------------
git installation
crate account with GitHub
 
Git- local repo
GitHub-remote repo

git and GitHub workflow:
-------------------------
working directory(add command) - staging area(commit command) - git repo(push command) - github


1.To create a local repo we need to use git init command
it is one time work for a project( for different project we need do again)
2.git status - shows the untracked files
3.git add -A -> add all untracked files
4.git add filename ->add only specific file
5. git add foldername -> add specific folder
6.git commit -m "message" ->commits code innlocal repo
7.create new repo in GitHub and copy the url
8.git remote add origin "url" 
make connection between local and remote ,one time job
9.git push origin master -> local to remote
10. git pull "remote repo url"
